    # Sends an SNMP-GET request to the remote agent for all OIDs specified in the _oids_ array. Returns a SnmpGetRequest object,

    # a hash, mapping requested OID values to results.
    # 
    # Optional arguments can be passed into _args_, including:
    # *  _return_raw_ - Return objects and errors as their raw SNMP types, such as SNMP::Integer instead of native Ruby integers, SNMP::OctetString instead of native Ruby strings, etc. (default: false)

    # a hash, mapping requested OID values to two-element arrays consisting of [_next_oid_ , _next_value_]. Any values that produced an
    # error will map to a symbol representing the error.
    # 
    # Optional arguments can be passed into _args_, including:

    # values. Values can either be specified as Ruby native strings/integers, or as SNMP-specific classes (SNMP::IpAddress, etc).
    # Returns a SnmpSetRequest object, which implements EM::Deferrable. From there, implement a callback/errback to fetch the result.
    # On success, the result will be a hash, mapping requested OID values to the returned value from the agent. Any values that were stored
    # successfully will map to _true_, otherwise, the value will map to a symbol representing the error.

    # Sends a series of SNMP-GETNEXT requests to simulate an SNMP "walk" operation. Given an OID prefix, the library will keep requesting the
    # next OID until that returned OID does not begin with the requested prefix. This gives the ability to retrieve entire portions of the
    # SNMP tree in one "operation". Multiple OID prefixes can be passed into the _oids_ array, and will be fetched in parallel. The function returns
    # a SnmpWalkRequest object, which implements EM::Deferrable. From there, implement a callback/errback to fetch the result. On success, the
    # result will be a hash, mapping requested OID prefixes to the returned value. Successful walks will be mapped to an array of two-element arrays,
    # each of which consists of [_oid_ , _value_]. Unsuccessful walks will be mapped to a symbol representing the error.

    # Optional arguments can be passed into _args_, including:
    # *  _return_raw_ - Return objects and errors as their raw SNMP types, such as SNMP::Integer instead of native Ruby integers, SNMP::OctetString instead of native Ruby strings, etc. (default: false)
    # *  _max_results_ - Maximum number of results to be returned for any single OID prefix (default: nil = unlimited)
