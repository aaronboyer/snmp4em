= SNMP Library for EventMachine

== Summary

This library extends the Ruby-SNMP[http://snmplib.rubyforge.org] to use the asynchronous EventMachine[http://rubyeventmachine.com] library for added performance and scalability. This allows code to scale monitoring applications to access a very high number of devices without the need for complex asynchronous I/O handling.

== Features

The initial version 0.1.0 of this software supports:

* SNMP v1 only
* SNMP Get, GetNext, Set, and Walk requests.
* Ability to query/set/walk multiple OIDs in parallel.

Future revisions of this library may support:

* SNMP v2c operations (this should be easy)
* Ability to act as an SNMP agent, responding to external queries.
* Ability to send/receive SNMP traps

There are no plans to support SNMP v3.

== Acknowledgements

* The SNMP packet processing is handled by the Ruby-SNMP[http://snmplib.rubyforge.org] library, by David Halliday
* EventMachine[http://rubyeventmachine.com], by Francis Cianfrocca and Aman Gupta
* All the helpful folks on the Freenode #eventmachine channel

== Examples

Coming soon!
